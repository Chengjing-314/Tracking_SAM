# Tracking_SAM
Language/Clicking grounded SAM + VOS for real-time video object tracking

## Prepare env

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to prepare environment.

Follow [MODEL_PREP.md](MODEL_PREP.md) to prepare pre-trained model weight.

## Run example

See all the iPython notebooks in the root project directory.

## TODOs

- [x] Add VOS
- [x] Add SAM
- [ ] Add VOS+SAM
- [ ] Add Clicking
- [ ] Add Grounding DINO for languaged-conditioned mask generation
- [ ] Serialize used models to ONNX for deployment (easy access and potential TRT optimization)
- [ ] Switch to FastSAM for faster inference
